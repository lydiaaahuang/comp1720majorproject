"Timeless attraction" is something that can withstand time and something we
are drawn too again and again. As humans and living organisms there are instincts
that are just nature and stay with us throughout time. The phenomenon “photo axis” is 
what draws insects such as moths towards the light. Light being a source of navigation 
for them. This idea can also be mirrored in humans, when stuck in a pitch-dark room our
instincts tell us to search for light. Similarly, we have stars and the moon to give us light at
night. However, this attraction to light can be almost fatal. Seen in moths when touching hot 
light bulbs. So, I wanted to convey this idea of fatal attraction being timeless. 

I wanted the experience to be a loop and for users to be able to stay in the one scene but have the theme
progress. This loop being an idea of timelessness and even when reaching the end, it restarts, and the insects are again attracted to the light. The beginning is the attraction to the light and the moths and bugs are all flying around. The ‘b’ key will
cause a blackout and the moths and bugs will fly around aimlessly without the light. When the mouse is pressed the attraction to the
light will happen and the insects will start to move towards the user’s mouse. When the moth is caught in the light it will switch scenes to \the fatal attraction and will turn into wings falling. symbolizing the zap that insects experience when touching the light, as the wings fall in a like manner. Finally, to emphasize this idea flowers will bloom as the light approaches them and shrink when getting too close. Another example of this fatal attraction of when plants grow towards the light but knowing that if they were to touch the light they would dry out or burn. 

I want the users to think about how we are attracted to things that are dangerous and can be possibly fatal. I want users to feel a bit bittersweet with this idea of attraction. How we can’t help but be hopelessly attracted to danger. Moths have been flying towards the light for years and continue to do so. In the way that attraction can make us blind sometimes, like Romeo and Juliet, a fatal love story. I wanted the colours to be sombre to reflect this emotion but also beautiful. The delicate wings of the moth flapping are graceful and the blooming of flowers. However, once the light touches it, it is ruined. 

I hope that after viewers view my art, they take the conversation further and discuss this idea of fatal attraction. The timeless nature of insects continuing to fly towards the light. The reality of how sometimes we are so attracted and infatuated we don’t recognise these dangers. I want my art to create a discussion.
