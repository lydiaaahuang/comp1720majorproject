For my artwork the opening scene is an eclipse of moths flying around with small insects. It’s black screen with a dim light. The simple black and white design is supposed to let users connect to it in their own way and allow for the art to be more symbolic and conceptual. Users may watch for a bit as an initial view of the insects. Then when the mouse is held the light will follow the mouse and the insects will begin to be attracted to the light following the users mouse. There are then two scenarios that could happen from her, the user could assume that the insects are supposed to fly towards the light or they’re not. Ideally the user would play with this function for a while as it may not be completely obvious that the insects are following the light. Then when the moth is caught on the light it will change ‘scenes.’

When the moth is caught, the moth will turn into a pile of wings and fall towards the bottom of the screen and the other moths and insects will disappear. When moving the mouse/light around flowers will begin blooming and them shrink as the mouse gets too close. Users will continue to see this black and white theme. Hopefully users will understand the confetti is the wings of the moths and the symbolism of the death of the insects touching the lights. This will then leave the screen blank which will nudge users to move the mouse around wondering what to do next. From there the flowers will begin to appear. The flowers ideally would support this idea of death and fatality. By this stage users would hopefully understand the idea of fatal attraction.

if users press the mouse they will be returned to the start and the same scene will be played again, symbolising this idea of timelessness and how nature tends to repeat. 

the blackout function may be hard to find as it is a key press event. When the key is pressed users will see a plain black background with just the insects and no light. They are flying aimlessly and go on and off screen. I hope with this scene it brings a serenity to the users and ideally users would sit and watch the freedom of the insects flying around. 

I would imagine in an actual exhibit that this would be projected in a dark square room. The insects would be able to fly wall to wall all around the room. Using sensors, the user would be the light source and walking around the room flowers will bloom on the floor and then shrink when the user is too close. The users would be welcome to touch the walls and when pressing a moth it would turn into the confetti wings.
